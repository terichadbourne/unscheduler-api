# Unscheduler API

The Unscheduler is an app for managing schedules for unconferences, inspired by my work as a co-organizer for [Offline Camp](http://offlinefirst.org/camp).

It's built in two parts:
* A front-end app, built with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS
   * [GitHub repo](https://github.com/terichadbourne/unscheduler-client)
   * [Live site](https://terichadbourne.github.io/unscheduler-client/), deployed on GitHub Pages
* A back-end API, built with Ruby on Rails
   * [GitHub repo](https://github.com/terichadbourne/unscheduler-api)
   * [Live site](https://unscheduler-api.herokuapp.com/), deployed on Heroku

## Remaining Documentation Requirements
* TODO Create 2 Github repos (one for your front-end and one for your back-end)
* TODO Pin both repositories on GitHub as a Popular Repository
* TODO Each repo will need a README.md file with a link to the other repo and an explanation of the what the app does and how it works.
* TODO Each repo must contain the link to both deployed sites
* TODO Complete the repository Description field and Website field with a meaningful sentence description of the application and link to the live URL github image
* TODO List technologies used
* TODO List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
* TODO Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
* TODO Your front-end repo's README should also have: Link to wireframes and user stories.
* TODO Your back-end repo's README should also have: Link to Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
